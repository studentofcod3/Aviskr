            The Obama administration endeavored to form a policy of great
            longevity and legal framework to govern the use of lethal drones,
            but it is unclear how those principles—and especially their
            limitations—will survive in the Donald J. Trump administration.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Trump administration may change aspects of the Obama
            administration’s legal framework. Nonetheless, elements that have
            broad support among military operators, such as a “near certainty”
            standard for targeted strikes, will likely survive.
          </p>
          <p>
            In any scenario in which utilised, lethal drones should be part of
            all-encompassing counterterrorism strategy, including updated,
            unambiguous legal authority from Congress.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, serve a host of military
            functions. Although they are predominantly used for surveillance,
            they are increasingly used as remotely operated weapons platforms.
            The United States’ lead role in the use of lethal drones makes it
            crucial for the country to help develop and enforce global norms
            shaping their use. The policy and legal framework governing the use
            of lethal drones in the fight against terrorism is especially
            important as President Trump and his administration currently reside
            in office. In its dwindling months, the Obama administration
            published the policies and procedures that had come to govern its
            use of lethal drones for so-called targeted strikes on suspected
            terrorists. Many observers have described the Obama administration’s
            approach as centralized, with final authority for lethal strikes
            reserved for the president, and requiring an imminent threat as well
            as near certainty about the identity of targets. In 2016, the Obama
            administration released the legal framework governing lethal drone
            strikes— including a declassified Presidential Policy Guidance from
            May 2013 and a sixty-one-page compendium of the internal
            decision-making processes—in a bid to institutionalize those
            procedures before leaving office. As Obama said in December 2016,
            “An informed public can scrutinize our actions and hold us to
            account.” Although the Obama administration made efforts to increase
            transparency, significant issues remain. For example, strikes are
            still carried out overtly by the Joint Special Operations Command
            (JSOC)—a subunit of the Department of Defense Special Operations
            Command—and covertly by Some important elements of the program are
            embraced by high-level military officials. The two agencies’
            different authorities, policies, and accountability mechanisms
            confuse oversight over the use of lethal drones.
