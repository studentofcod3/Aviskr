        With a name based on the Sanskrit (आविष्कृत) word meaning ‘to reveal’ or
        ‘to make visible’, Aviskr seeks to spot patterns and discrepancies alike
        within the world of international affairs and foreign policy and make
        apparent through a visual means. Through a deep rooted, data driven
        analytical approach married with supplementary, nuanced policy analysis,
        Aviskr aims to embody the successful union of data and policy
        prescription.
      </p>
      <p>
        Avsikr is inherently subscribed to presenting data in an interactive and
        engaging form, in order to truly resonate with the audience and start
        dialogue on current affairs at all levels for the wide spectrum that
        makes society.
      </p>
      <p>
        A key element of this lies within a medium of communication which
        predates modern and ancient civilization – imagery. Merging the
        statistics and written analysis with engaging artistic work allows a
        greater depth of understanding and, most importantly, conveys the
        message we look to share in its simplest form: Signs and symbols rule
        the world, not words, nor laws.
