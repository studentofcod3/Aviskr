        With a name based on the Sanskrit (आविष्कृत) word meaning ‘to reveal’ or ‘to make visible’, Aviskr seeks to spot
        patterns and discrepancies within the world of international affairs and foreign policy - increasing the
        transparency and accountability of actors on the global stage. Through a data driven, analytical approach
        combined with nuanced investigative analysis, Aviskr aims to embody the successful union of data and policy
        prescription.
      </p>
      <p>
        Work completed under the Aviskr moniker has been lobbied in EU Parliament, the UN General Assembly and various
        Think Tanks in Westminster. Aviskr have also lectured at King’s College London, alongside consultation with
        outlets and institutes based in Europe, the US and MENA regions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aviskr was founded in 2018 by three independent analysts united in their philanthropic mission to unmask the
        bureaucratic nature of vital information and trends, in order to bring a greater clarity to the public in an
        accessible format.
      </p>
      <p>
        Merging the statistics and written commentary with engaging, interactive artistic work allows a greater depth of
        understanding and, most importantly, conveys the message we look to share in its simplest form:
      </p>
      <p>
        Signs and symbols rule the world, not words, nor laws.
